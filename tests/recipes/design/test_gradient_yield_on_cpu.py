"""Gradient-yield metrics, and the guarantee that they cost other recipes nothing.

Two things are checked here. The first is the arithmetic: which rows produced no gradient,
and how that splits by infra failure. The second is a boundary condition on the three places
this arm touches verl's trainer -- each must sit behind an environment gate, so a run of any
other recipe executes none of it. That is a stated requirement, not a preference, which is
why it gets an assertion rather than a comment.
